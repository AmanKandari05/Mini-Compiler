# Mini-Compiler
Mini Compiler: Developed a web-based compiler frontend using Flask that performs lexical analysis, parsing, semantic checks, and generates intermediate code for C/C++ Python programs. The system provides user-friendly interface for code input and display tokens, syntax and semantic errors and IR, demonstrating key compiler phases.
